Here's an updated list of broken systems that we can implement on this project. The update is related to the categories. First, we defined it as categories related to domains. Now, they are related to problems domains, but without mentioning the problem itself. 

These are not backlog or roadmap, these are only ideas of broken systems that can be implemented or not. Each of broken system is grouped based on its problem domain and it is rated according to the following criterias:

| 🟢 Easy Systems                       | 🟡 Medium Systems           | 🔴 Hard Systems                      |
| ------------------------------------ | -------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Simple configuration changes         | Multiple component changes | Distributed system concepts         |
| Standard library solutions           | Some infrastructure setup  | Complex infrastructure requirements |
| Clear cause-and-effect relationships | Moderate research required | Advanced debugging needed           |
| Single-file modifications            | Mid-level concepts         | Enterprise-level patterns           |
| Beginner-friendly concepts           | Testing complexity         | Multiple interacting components     |
