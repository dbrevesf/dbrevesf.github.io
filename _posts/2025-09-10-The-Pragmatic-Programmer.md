# The Pragmatic Programmer

It's been a while since I started reading the classic **The Pragmatic Programmer**, by David Thomas and Andrew Hunt. It 
has been a fascinating journey to read it after more than 10 years since I started my career as a software engineer. 
I wish I could have read it before. It should be recommended to any new grad. The first version of this book was 
written in 1999 and it's still remarkably relevant today. 

During my reading, I usually write a short summary for every chapter, mentioning the highlights, things that I would 
like to remember when needed. So, I'm starting this new category to share them with you.

Enjoy!
