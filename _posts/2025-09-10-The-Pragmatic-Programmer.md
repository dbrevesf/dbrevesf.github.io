# The Pragmatic Programmer

It's been a while since I started to read the classic **The Pragmatic Programmer**, by David Thomas and Andrew Hunt. It 
has been a fascinating journey to read that after more than 10 years since I started my career as a software engineer. 
I wish I could have read it before. It should be recommended for any new grad. The first version of this book was 
written in 1999 and it's still remarkably relevant today. 

During my reads, I use to write a short summary for every chapter, mentioning the highlights, things that I would 
like to remember when needed. So, I'm starting this new category to share it with you.

Enjoy!
