Hi there!

First of all, thank you for being here! Let me introduce myself to you: I'm Daniel, a Brazilian computer engineer 

As you may have noticed, this is just an attempt at a personal blog. I created it just to take notes of some things that I'm currently studying. Unfortunately (or not), I'm a "Writing Learner" and I really need to write down every conclusion and thoughts in order to keep them in my mind. 

So far it's been working good and I really hope that one of my annotations could be helpful for anyone besides me. I also have a [Medium profile][medium] that I used to post some information about a personal project that's currently in standby. Check it out for more information. Here in the blog, you can also have access to all my social networks and GitHub repository. So, feel free to contact me. I'll love to talk to you about anything related or not with my posts.

Cheers! :)
