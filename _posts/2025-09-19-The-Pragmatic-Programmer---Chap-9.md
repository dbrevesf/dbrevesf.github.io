## Pragmatic Teams
- Pragmatic team: 
  - Under 10 members.
  - Members come and go rarely.
  - Everyone knows everyone well.
  - Everyone trusts and depends on each other.
- Quality can come only from the individual contributions of all team members.
- Encourage everyone to actively monitor the environment for changes.
- Schedule your knowledge portfolio to make it happen.
- Frictionless means it's easy and low-ceremony to ask questions, share your progress, your problems, your insights and learnings, and to stay aware of what your teammates are doing.
- Deliver when users need it.
- Overly investing in any particular methodology can leave you blind to alternatives.

## Pragmatic Starter Kit
- Build, test, and deployment should be triggered via commits or pushes to version control service.
- Test easy, test often, test automatically.
- Use saboteurs to test your testing.
- Test state coverage, not code coverage.
- Once a human tester finds a bug, it shoudl be the last time a human tester finds that bug. You need to add a new test to trap it next time.
- Don't use manual procedures. 

## Delight Your Users
- Delight users, don't just deliver code.
- **You are a problem solver!**

# Postface

- First, do no harm.
- Don't enable scumbags.
- It's your life. Share it. Celebrate it. Build it and HAVE FUN!
