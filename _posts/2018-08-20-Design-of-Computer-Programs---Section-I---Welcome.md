Today I started the [Design of Computer Programs course on Udacity](https://br.udacity.com/course/design-of-computer-programs--cs212, "Design of COmputer Programs"). This course is lectured by the Director of Research at Google Inc. Peter Norvig. From this day on, I'll post some interesting things that I hope to learn. Stay tuned so we can learn together! :)
