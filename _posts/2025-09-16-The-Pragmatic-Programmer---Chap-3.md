## The Power of Plain Text
- Keep knowledge in plain text.
- All software becomes legacy as soon as it is written.
- Mind the difference between human readable and human understandable.

## Shell Games
- Use the power of command shells.

## Power Editing
- Achieve editor fluency.

## Version Controll
- Always use version controll.
- Keep local configuration and important informations about local setup under a VCS. So, if your computer dies, you can put a new one quick and easy:
  - Shell configurations.
  - Installed softwares.
  - Editor configurations.
  - Aliases.
  - Etc.

## Debugging
- Debugging is just problem solving.
- Fix the problem, not the blame.
- **Don't panic!**
- **Always** look for the root cause.
- Fail test before fix the code.
- **READ THE DAMN ERROR MESSAGE!**
- Leverage Binary Search during debugging.
- Don't assume it. Prove it!

## Text Manipulation
- Learn a text manipulation language: perl, python, ruby, etc.

**Keep an engineering day book!**
