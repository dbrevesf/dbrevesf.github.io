## 3. Software Entropy

- Don't let entropy win. 

## 4. Stone Soup and Boiled Frogs

- Be a catalyst for change.
- It's easier to ask forgiveness than it is to get permission.
- Remember the big picture. 

## 5. Good Enough Software

## 6. Your Knowledge Portfolio

- An investment in knowledge always pays the best interest. 
- Don't put all your technicall eggs in one basket.
- Invest regularly in your knowledge portfolio.

## 7. Communicate

- A good idea is an orphan without effective communication.
- Know your audience.
- Know what you want to say.
- Choose your moment. 
- Choose a style.
- Make it look good.
- Be a listener.
- Get back to people.
- The more effective your communication, the more influential you become.
- Build documentation in, don't bolt it on. 
  - "Bolt something on": add something in a rush way, treating as secondary need.
